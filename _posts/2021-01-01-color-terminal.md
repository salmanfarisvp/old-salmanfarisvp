TL;DR -The Color Terminal can be used to pick color from physical things by scanning its surface with Seeed Wio Terminal and TCS34725.

A color picker (also color chooser or color tool) is a graphical user interface widget, usually found within graphics software or online, used to select colors and sometimes to create color schemes. ([WiKi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_picker))
